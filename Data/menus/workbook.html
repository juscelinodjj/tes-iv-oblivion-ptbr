<IMG src="Book/fancy_font/h_62x62.dds" width=62 height=62>e was born in the ash among the Velothi, anon Chimer, before Ayem came first to 
the village of the netchimen and her shadow was that of 
Boethiah, who was the Prince of Plots, and things unknown 
and known would fold themselves around her until they were 
like stars or the messages of stars. Ayem took a netchiman's 
wife and said:
<HR> <BR>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. In you is an 
image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, 
which you will repeat to it until mystery comes.'</FONT>
 <P>
<DIV align=center> <IMG src="Book/Vehk_201x325.dds" width=201 height=325"> </DIV>
 <P>
<HR>
<DIV align=left>Then Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where dreughs 
took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's 
wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might 
give birth to the image as an egg. There she stayed for seven or eight months.
<P>
Then Seht came to the netchiman's wife and said:
<P>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'I am the Clockwork King of the Three in One. In you is an egg of 
my brother-sister, who possesses invisible knowledge of words and swords, which 
you shall nurture until the Hortator comes.'</FONT>
<P><P>
And Seht then extended his hands and multitudes of homunculi came forth, each 
like a glimmering rope through the water, and they raised the netchiman's wife 
back to the surface world and set her down on the shoals of Azura's coast. There 
she lay for seven or eight more months, caring for the egg-knowledge by 
whispering to it the Codes of Mephala and the prophecies of Veloth and even the 
forbidden teachings of Trinimac.
<P>
Seven Daedra came to her one night and each one gave to the egg new motions that 
could be achieved by certain movements of the bones. These are called the Barons 
of Move Like This. Then an eighth Daedroth came, and he was a Demiprince, called 
Fa-Nuit-Hen, or the Multiplier of Motions Known. And Fa-Nuit-Hen said:
<P>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'Whom do you wait for?'</FONT>
<P><P>
To which the netchiman's wife said the Hortator.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'Go to the land of the Indoril in three months' time, for that is 
when war comes. I return now to haunt the warriors who fell and still wonder why. 
But first I show you this.'</FONT>
<P><P>
Then the Barons and the Demiprince joined together into a pillar of fighting 
styles terrible to behold and they danced before the egg and its learning image.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'Look, little Vehk, and find the face behind the splendor of my 
bladed carriage, for in it is delivered the unmixed conflict path, perfect in 
every way. What is its number?'</FONT>
<P><P>
It is said the number is the number of birds that can nest in an ancient tibrol 
tree, less three grams of honest work, but Vivec in his later years found a 
better one and so gave this secret to his people.
<HR>
<FONT COLOR="332288" face=3>'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but 
in my right hand is how it could have won against me. Love is under my will only.'</FONT>
<P><P>
The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.
